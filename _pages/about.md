Ruiqing Wang is a PhD student in Chemistry at Tulane University. In 2019, she obtained her B.S. from South China University of Technology in Guangzhou. At 2023, She started her master of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, and will graduate in summer 2025. At July - October 2024, she started her research intern at Coffee elf. In 2025, she is expected to get her PhD and master degree. She is now open to work in computational chem/bioinfomatics.

Ruiqing has a multidisciplinary background in chemistry, computer science, and bioinformatics, working at the intersection of molecular dynamics, machine learning, and sustainable chemical engineering. Her research spans diverse areas, including protein-ligand docking, peptide aggregation prediction, and anion-protein interaction studies.  Her work on coffee grounds recycling showcase to creating impactful solutions at the interface of chemistry and environmental science. She published one paper related on maromolecular binding and currently working on protein-binding manuscript. Connect with her for projects or discussions on chemistry, computational science, or green technology innovation!
