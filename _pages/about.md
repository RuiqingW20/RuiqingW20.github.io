Ruiqing Wang is a Contract Scientist III (Drug Product Development – Biologics) at AbbVie Inc. (via Mindlance), where she supports late-stage monoclonal-antibody programs such as ABBV-383 and ABBV-400. Her work focuses on formulation stability, analytical method development, and data-driven modeling to ensure the robustness and regulatory readiness of biologic therapeutics.She earned her Ph.D. in Chemistry from Tulane University (May 2025), where she investigated ionic-environment effects on supramolecular and peptide aggregation systems,and concurrently completed a M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology (Aug 2025), specializing in computational modeling, machine learning, and high-performance computing.

Her academic research explores protein–ligand docking, peptide aggregation prediction, and anion-protein interactions, providing mechanistic insight into molecular recognition and self-assembly. She has published two papers regarding protein aggregation mechanism and ion interaction with marcomolecule. Beyond pharmaceutical science, Ruiqing has also applied data-driven methods in sustainable chemical engineering, such as her project on coffee-grounds recycling for green materials, demonstrating her commitment to interdisciplinary innovation 

Integrating her experimental and computational expertise, Ruiqing is passionate about applying AI and data-science approaches to biologics R&D, and is currently open to opportunities in computational chemistry, bioinformatics, or data-driven drug development.
