 ## Molecular Dynamics On Peptides and small molecules 
Peptides and small proteins serve as models to study the interactions of salts and buffers with biomolecules, revealing their impact on protein secondary and tertiary structures and downstream physicochemical properties. These studies utilize intrinsically disordered peptides, such as N-terminal segments from amyloid proteins. We employ methods including MD simulations, NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry, light scattering, and CD spectroscopy. Below is a visualization of a peptide with an associated anion cloud from MD results.
