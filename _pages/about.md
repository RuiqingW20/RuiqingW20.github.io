Ruiqing Wang is a PhD student in Chemistry at Tulane University. In 2019, she obtained her B.S. from South China University of Technology in Guangzhou, a beautiful and warm city in south China. Then she moved to New Orleans, the south of U.S, to get her PhD. At 2023, She started her master of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, to get a better understanding of programming and computation. At July - October 2024, she started her research intern at Coffee elf, which focused on recycling and DoE in chemical engineering. She is now open to work and will love to get a position related to computational and analytical chemoinfo/bioinfo job. 

Ruiqing has a multidisciplinary background in chemistry, computer science, and bioinformatics, working at the intersection of molecular dynamics, machine learning, and sustainable chemical engineering. Her research spans diverse areas, including protein-ligand docking, peptide aggregation prediction, and anion-protein interaction studies. Leveraging tools like enhanced sampling techniques, HPC, and interactive 3D visualization using PyMOL and custom Python scripts. Her work on coffee grounds recycling showcase to creating impactful solutions at the interface of chemistry and environmental science.She always love to learn new things and challenge herself with interesting topics and projects. Connect with her for projects or discussions on chemistry, computational science, or green technology innovation!
